                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Hi there,</p>
                        <p>I'm Kathi Gerth. Having worked in the International Education Industry for more than ten years, I am still fascinated by this wonderful and interesting industry which is a combination of my passions: education, people and languages. I have been able to work in a variety of positions and with a wide range people from all over the world.</p>
                        <p>Those who have the pleasure of working in the International Education Industry know that it is a very rewarding and diverse environment but at the same time it can be extremely busy! Due to travels, meetings, conferences and the regular day-to-day running of a language school, the list of things that need to be done is usually long and can be challenging to find experienced staff, make time to train people spend a huge amount of money on long term hires.</p>
                        <p>After having held senior positions in the Marketing and Operations departments of small to medium-sized businesses in the industry, I decided to start Gecko Projects to be able to help language schools with challenges they are facing.</p>
                        <p>Similar to a gecko, I am very adaptive to a new environment, a new project or challenge that is thrown at me. I am someone who calmly takes each new challenge in my stride with focus, energy and initiative and I am passionate about my work and go above and beyond to ensure it is carried out to the highest level.</p>
                        <p>Just get in touch to find out more!</p>
